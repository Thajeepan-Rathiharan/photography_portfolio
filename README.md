# My photography portfolio
[Link to my photography portfolio](https://thajeepan-rathiharan.github.io/photography_portfolio/)

## Purpose
- I had some photos saved on my laptop from my camera from my photography module in my media production course at university, and to not let them go to waste, I decided to incorporate my coding language skills to make a simple but fully responsive photography portfolio with some photos that I am proud to have taken.

- As of right now I have only put two photos on there, but once I find more of my photoshoots I will add more of them on to my site.

## Software used to create the site
- HTML
- CSS
- Visual Studio Code

## Credits
All photos that I will put into this are taken by me and only me.
